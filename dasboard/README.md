# React_Dashboard

Admin Panel with one dashboard, three pages, four apps and seven working charts!

## [About me](https://dew-ill.vercel.app/about)

<em>
My first contact with programming was in 2016 with VB6 and since then, it's been something I've always wanted to do. Coding is also an art for me. I love to think that I now have the opportunity to draw and bring my creations to life through codes. I love the whole process.

Passionate about learning React.Js I've been developing some small projects in order to fully master this fantastic Javascript library!

My vision is to make people's daily lives easier and more dynamic with the use of technology. Now almost everything is getting better than ever, and I truly believe that we are in a position to create magnificent things that help the world become a much better and more inclusive place.

I was quite lacking in terms of documenting my projects and using agile methodologies, so I decided to raise the level of my work, and therefore I intend to take a little longer to complete this project to dedicate myself to writing this documentation.

### Now that we know each other a little, let's make a program...

## Setup

- [x] **Project start.**

  - [x] React project creation

    > [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

  - [x] Tailwind installation

    > <br />
    >
    > [Install Tailwind CSS with Create React App](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/reate-react-app)
    >
    > <hr />
    >
    > **Note:(en)**
    >
    > > In the first attempt to use Tailwind CSS, there was a small failure in the project configuration. As I couldn't solve it and I didn't understand the problem, I decided to restart the react dashboard setup process for the sake of understanding.
    > >
    > > - **Solved:**
    >
    > > I encountered a problem with Tailwind (My first contact with this CSS framework) so I decided to follow the documentation and this solved my problem
    >
    > ```node
    > $ npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
    > $ npx tailwindcss init -p
    > ```
    >
    > <hr />
    > <br />
    >
    > **Nota:(pt-br)**
    >
    > > Na primeira tentativa de utilização do Tailwind CSS, houve uma pequena falha na configuração do projeto. Como não copnsegui resolver e não entendi o problema, decidi reiniciar o processo de setup do react dashboard a fins de entendimento
    > >
    > > - **Resolvido:**
    >
    > > Encontrei um problema com o Tailwind (meu primeiro contato com esse framework CSS) então resolvi seguir a documentação e isso resolveu meu problema
    >
    > ```node
    > $ npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
    > $ npx tailwindcss init -p
    > ```
    >
    > <hr />
    > <br />

  - [x] Installation of dependencies
        <br />
    > Dependencies can be installed manually just by changing the package.json file, or following the [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app) documentation walkthrough
  - [x] structure folders > <br /> > > **Folders** > > In this step, the components, pages, contexts and data folders were created. > The data folder is serving as a Fake API, but later, I will make an Api Rest and connect it to the project. > <br>
